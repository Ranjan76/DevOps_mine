If you want to run the command for both `ec2-user` (typically for Amazon Linux) and `ubuntu` (typically for Ubuntu), you can use Ansible's group or host_vars functionality to specify the user per host. However, for a quick command-line example, you would need to run two separate commands.

Here are the commands:

For the Amazon Linux instance (`ec2-user`):
```bash
ansible all -i '18.209.59.137,' -m ping -u ec2-user --private-key deployer
```

For the Ubuntu instance (`ubuntu`):
```bash
ansible all -i '18.209.59.137,' -m ping -u ubuntu --private-key deployer
```

Alternatively, you can define the inventory with specific user settings for each host in an inventory file and then run a single command. Here's an example:

1. Create an inventory file, `hosts.ini`:

```ini
[amazon]
18.209.59.137 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=deployer

[ubuntu]
18.209.59.138 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=deployer
```

2. Run the Ansible command with the inventory file:

```bash
ansible all -i hosts.ini -m ping
```

This approach allows you to manage multiple hosts with different configurations more easily. Adjust the IP addresses and user configurations as needed.
