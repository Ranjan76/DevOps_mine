The error you're encountering is caused by the fact that Jenkins now requires Java 17 or higher to run, and you're currently using Java 11, which is no longer supported by Jenkins for the version you're trying to install.

Error Breakdown:
"Running with Java 11 from /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64, which is older than the minimum required version (Java 17)"
"Supported Java versions are: [17, 21]"
Jenkins no longer supports Java 11 starting from certain versions (e.g., Jenkins 2.397 and above). Therefore, you need to upgrade to a supported version of Java (either Java 17 or Java 21).

Solution: Install Java 17 or Java 21
Step 1: Install Java 17 (Recommended)
To resolve this issue, you'll need to install Java 17 on your system.

Update your package list:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Install OpenJDK 17:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
Verify the installation:

After installation, verify that the correct version of Java is installed:

bash
Copy code
java -version
The output should show something like:

java
Copy code
openjdk version "17.0.x" 202x-xx-xx
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.x+xx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.x+xx, mixed mode)
Step 2: Set Java 17 as the Default Java Version
If you have multiple versions of Java installed (e.g., Java 11 and Java 17), you’ll need to set Java 17 as the default.

Use the update-alternatives command to configure the default Java:

bash
Copy code
sudo update-alternatives --config java
You will see a list of installed Java versions. Choose the number corresponding to Java 17.

Verify the default Java version:

bash
Copy code
java -version
Ensure that it shows Java 17 as the default.

Step 3: Restart Jenkins Service
After you’ve installed and configured Java 17, you can restart the Jenkins service.

Restart Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
Check Jenkins service status:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status jenkins
This should show that Jenkins is now running, as it is using a supported version of Java.

Step 4: Verify Jenkins is Running
Once Jenkins has restarted successfully, you should be able to access the Jenkins UI at:

arduino
Copy code
http://<EC2_Public_IP>:8080
Where <EC2_Public_IP> is the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

Summary of Steps:
Install Java 17 or Java 21.
Set the newly installed Java version as the default.
Restart Jenkins to use the new Java version.
This should resolve the issue you're facing with Jenkins failing to start due to the Java version mismatch. If you encounter any other errors, feel free to share the details, and I can help further troubleshoot!
